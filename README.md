PingPong
========

Shows how to implement a simple request-reply example using multiple Java Actor APIs, as a benchmark.

In particular, JActors, PActors, Akka, and simple threads. More to come.

In particular, we would like submissions for:

* http://www.malhar.net/sriram/kilim/
* http://code.google.com/p/jetlang/
* http://code.google.com/p/korus/

And we would accept submissions for other actor frameworks, that we do not know about.
